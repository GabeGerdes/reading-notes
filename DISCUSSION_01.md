# This is a discussion about markdown

Markdown is a easy to use markup language created in 2004. Markup languages are used to make code readable to humans, 
this means that Markup languages use standard words instead of programming syntax.

Markdown has it's own symbols for the code. For example, to turn simple text into a large heading, all you need to put
in front of the text is `#` then your text.

`#` fake text =
# fake text

To make subheaders you add more `#`. You can add up to 6 subheaders.
Some other examples are...
