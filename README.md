## Hello!
When someone has a *growth mindset* it simply means that they have a mindset that alows them to become better or **grow** as a person.

3 things I can do to stay remind myself to stay in a growth mindset is:
1. Don't become jealous of others success, maybe praise them for it instead
2. When I become bogged down by work just remember: no pain, no gain
3. Sometimes I can't solve a problem right away, sometimes I just need to take a step back
